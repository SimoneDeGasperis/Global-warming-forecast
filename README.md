# Global-warming-forecast

The project aims to forecast climate change by studying the time series of the Earth's temperature. The dataset used was made available by Berkeley Earth organization and can be found on Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/berkeleyearth/climate-change-earth-surface-temperature-data

The project contains: 
- global-warming-arima-model.ipynb the main notebook that implements an ARIMA model (Autoregressive integrated moving average) to forecast Earth temperature evolution until the year 2050. The same notebook si also available on Kaggle at: https://www.kaggle.com/simonedegasperis/global-warming-arima-model
